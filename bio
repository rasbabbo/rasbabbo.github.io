		<h1> A Small Bio</h1>
		<p>	In the fall of 1991 instead of matriculating straight into college, I was fortunate enough to travel and live through what was then the last vestiges of the Iron Curtain.  I remember walking under the desolate and abandoned Brandenburger Gate in Berlin, strolling casually up to the headquarters of the KGB and trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to ply their placard of their front wall.  Across the street, Soviet military wares were being sold for pennies on the ruble.  The next day I jumped into a empty boxcar bound for Moscow only to be apprehended outside of Warsaw by an armed Soviet soldier who, upon learning I was American, invited me to join him and the rest of his cadre for the remainder of the trip.  To me, a child of the Cold War, these stories seemed surreal and utterly inconceivable.  But it was instances like these, and many more, that solidified for me the enormity of international policy, the celerity of political change once it has gained momentum, and the power and efficacy that the ideas of justice and freedom have over people.  My subsequent travels through Central America and Europe have only crystallized these beliefs.</br>

Upon my return I chose to study philosophy and literature in an effort to gain a normative understanding of western culture.  I’ve always felt both a desire and duty to be of service to society and believed it would be both irresponsible and hypocritical to espouse egalitarian principles without a foundational understanding and opinion of those conventions.  After graduation I soon found the stage the most efficient medium for me to express my ideals.  I’ve performed hundreds of shows in front of thousands of people, garnered awards and critical acclaim and been lucky enough to have collaborated with some of the world's most talented artists and artistic organizations. Yet in lieu of this I still find myself intrinsically drawn to foreign policy and affairs.</br>  

	While requiring the effort of a full-time job, being an actor rarely pays the bills.  Hence over the years I’ve worked many a different job.  I’ve worked as a fisherman in Alaska, as a close-captioning technician, a bartender for a Syrian prince.  As a videographer I’ve documented some of the largest lawsuits in the world: Facebook, Enron, Vivendi, Parmalat, Netscape, WorldCom. I’ve taught Shakespeare to young people, English to Czeckoslavakians, and mentored juvenile delinquints in playwrighting.  In the early 2000’s I worked as a day-trader and my interest and knowledge of international affairs was an invaluable source both to myself and colleagues.  At the time I was particularly interested in how the Chinese government was going to rectify it’s promulgation of a middle-class consumer-based computer literate society with goods whose inherent purpose was the dissemination of information and their government’s policies of censorship and a highly restricted press. </br> 

I find IR so fascinating because it seems to practically meld many sciences that would otherwise exist in their own bubbles.  As a Philosophy major I saw first-hand that, quite frankly, current philosophy exists for itself and for other philosophers.  Rarely does it have an effect on policy, public sentiment, art, or other science.  On the other hand, IR is an amalgamate of theory, history and tactical application.  It has an end-game, and an application.  It has both global and human implications and consequences.  Such as a Soviet soldier and an interloping American backpacker becoming fast friends when just a few years earlier they were enemies. </p>
